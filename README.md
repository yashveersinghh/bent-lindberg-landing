# 🎉 First Landing Page – HTML & CSS Practice

Hey everyone! 👋

This is my **first-ever coding project**, built using **basic HTML and CSS**.

I created a simple **landing page** as a clone of **Digital Designer Bent Lindberg’s** portfolio. The goal was to practice structure, layout, and styling fundamentals.
